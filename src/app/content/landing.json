          "question": "Which AI tools are supported?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Can I stay fully local?",
          "answer": "Yes. Context Vault runs entirely on your machine by default — data stays in plain markdown files and the SQLite index never leaves your disk. No account or network connection required. You can migrate to the hosted tier later if you need cross-device sync or team sharing."

        },
        {
          "question": "What happens to my data if I cancel?",
          "answer": "Nothing. Your vault is plain markdown files — export them at any time with one command. If you're on the hosted tier, you get a full data export before your account closes. No lock-in."

          "question": "Can my whole team use Context Vault?",
          "answer": "Yes. The Team tier gives every member their own vault plus a shared team vault. One invite link, one connect command per person. An admin dashboard shows usage and lets you manage members."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Context Vault free?",
          "answer": "The open-source local server is free forever. The hosted tier (cloud sync, team sharing, Chrome extension backend) is available on a subscription basis — no usage-based pricing, no surprise bills."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you charge per request?",
          "answer": "No. Local mode has no limits. The hosted tier is priced per seat, not per query — so a productive session that saves 200 entries costs the same as a quiet one."
